    "\n",
    "The hello dialect provides 3 basic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `hello.constant`: Constant operation that turns a literal into a SSA value.\n",
    "* `hello.print`: You guessed it, a print operation.\n",
    "* `hello.world`: Operation that prints \"Hello, World\".\n",

    "For a more detialed description of the operations checkout the [README of the Hello Dialect repo](https://github.com/Lewuathe/mlir-hello#operations).\n",

    "\n",
    "We start by setting up CMake with a minimal set of commands to build our project, for that we need a `CMakeList.txt` file:"
