Great efforts but not help to get a unified language onto an accelerator. Systems programmers dont just seek performance, they also want a lot of “predictability and control” over how compute happens.\nPython subsets: For example TorchScript, which uses Python like syntax, they can be easier to learn. Sadly not wide adoption. Generally dont interoperate with the Python ecosystem, missing tooling (debugger). This approaches attempt to solve a weak point of Python, but are not as good as Python’s strong points. This approaches drive fragmentation and incompatibility makes migration difficult.\nEmbedded DSLs in Python: Think of Python decorators. They maintain compatibility with all Python ecosystem. Unfortunately the mini-language usually dont integrate well with debuggers and other workflow tooling."

C++ and C in this case.\nThen we make sure that we locate the MLIR package (and LLVM subsequentially) and load its specific details.\nThis is the most basic CMake setup that you need to start working on your own dialect. You can already try to build your project, as follows:"
